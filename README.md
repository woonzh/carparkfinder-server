# carparkfinder-server

This is the code for the server. The code for the android app is located in another git directory

## Overview
This is an android app which locates carparks nearby or based on your search destination. 
Carparks displayed are based on your search criterions. 
This map auto centers itself as you drive / move except after a direct search
This app redirects you to google maps for navigation as well.

## Data source
Carpark availability is extracted from data.gov.sg through a cron job.
Additional carpark information is extracted from another LTA data source on a cron job. This is to facilliate google maps polling and information display.

The app communicates with the server via API endpoints.
